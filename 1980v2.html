            <h1>music</h1>
                <p>In the United States, MTV was launched and music videos began to have a larger effect on the record industry. Pop artists such as Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Duran Duran, Prince, and Madonna mastered the format and helped turn this new product into a profitable business. New wave and synthpop were developed by many British and American artists, and became popular phenomena throughout the decade, especially in the early and mid-Eighties. Music grew fragmented and combined into subgenres such as house, goth, and rap metal.</p>

            <h1>film</h1>
                <p>The 1980s saw the return of studio-driven films, coming from the filmmaker-driven New Hollywood era of the 1970s.[23] The period was when 'high concept' films gained popularity, where movies were to be easily marketable and understandable, and, therefore, they had short cinematic plots that could be summarized in one or two sentences. The modern Hollywood blockbuster is the most popular film format from the 1980s. Producer Don Simpson[24] is usually credited with the creation of the high-concept picture of the modern Hollywood blockbuster.</p>

                <p>There were many notable sports happenings throughout the decade within a diverse array of sporting events. The 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow were disrupted by a boycott led by the United States and 64 other countries in protest of the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, while the 1980 Winter Olympics were well remembered for the Miracle on Ice, where a young United States hockey team defeated the heavily favored Soviet Red Army team and went on to win the gold medal.</p>
